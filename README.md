# The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure (with the DEC Alpha backend)

This is a work-in-progress effort to make the DEC Alpha LLVM backend
work again (it was removed from the LLVM tree quite a few years ago).

Current status: compiles and passes all existing codegen tests.

The current issues are tracked in [the TODO file](llvm/lib/Target/Alpha/TODO.txt).
